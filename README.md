<h1>Flask Product Analytics Report</h1>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This repo exists as a personal project to combine the Python pandas and flask module into a working project. Using sample data from a ficitonal e-shop, we create report metrics that we would like to output to an endpoint via JSON format for a given date. We want our enpoint report to have the folllowing metrics:

– The total number of customers on a given day.

– The total amount of the day's discounts.

– The total quantity of items sold on a given day.

– The day's average order total

– The total commissions earned on a given day.

– The average commission rate per order on a given day.

– The total commissions received that day for each promotion.

More details about the project can be found below.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Run the application by typing `python -m flask run` in the integrated terminal to launch the Flask development server. By default, the development server searches for `app.py`. When you use Flask, the following output ought to appear:

```sh
* Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Debug mode: on
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Once running, follow the url link provided in the terminal, being `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or `http://localhost:5000/` also works).

You are greeted with an endpoint that takes a `Date:` as an input via a form. The date range is from `2019-08-01` until `2019-09-29` as there are 60 days in total from the data provided. This can be changed on `line 31` in `forms.html`.

Once you have selected a date, click on submit and below `Results:` you will get the necessary endpoint response in a `JSON` format. The promotion ids 1 – 5 are from Google Ads, Organics Google, Organic DuckDuckGo, DuckDuckGo Ads, Bing respectively.

The tests can be run by typing `pytest` in the integrated terminal.
